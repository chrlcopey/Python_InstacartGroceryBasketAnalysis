# Instacart Sales Analysis & Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on analyzing Instacart’s sales data to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior. As an analyst, the goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify customer segments and provide insights for a targeted marketing strategy. By understanding different customer profiles and their shopping habits, Instacart can optimize marketing efforts and improve sales performance. The findings will help stakeholders develop data-driven campaigns to enhance customer engagement and boost product sales.
